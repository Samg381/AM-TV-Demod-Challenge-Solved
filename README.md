# Original challenge:
fs = 48khz

wav file is an IQ file, which contains a
AM Signal 

the AM Signal is modulating a image not voice.

image is 800x800


image is a amazon claim code.

demod the am signal, first 800 samples are first line in image,  second 800 samples are second line in the image.

total samples =  800 x 800

good luck
